Idea:
Using Machine Learning algorithms to improve water supply systems across a fixed size of land. Effective, equitable water distribution is important for communities sharing water resources. I find remarkable similarity in the requirements of robust, resilient water distributions systems and computer networks powering the Internet. 

Network routing algorithms find the best route among the options based on the configured route metrics such as the number of hops, distance, speed, connection quality etc. I want to research and implement a solution that has the potential to leverage the network routing protocols for community water distribution management systems by modelling water analogous to data in network systems. 
Environment:
Cloud Services, IoT based device and IMU
